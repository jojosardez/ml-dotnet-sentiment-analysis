Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject&#39;s importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.   If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion.

The disparity in the pie chart seems mainly caused by that US institute counting 45% ancestor worship and traditional beliefs as religion, wheras officially that 45% are non-believers.

To my mind chữ Hán can still include Japanese and Chinese, but chữ nho is clearly Vietnamese-only, and is what Lonely Planet uses. Do you have any view? Cheers!   </td>

The two schools are brother and sister schools, and as per the History section in the HNMCS article, &quot;&quot;The Felician Sisters and St. Michael&#39;s College School co-founded the independent Holy Name of Mary College School&quot;&quot;. As such, it is appropriate to contain some basic information about HNMCS in this article and in the same way, to include some basic information about SMCS in the Holy Name of Mary College School article. The inclusion of the school type (independent), gender (all-girls), and religious information (Catholic) of Holy Name of Mary College School in this article, is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type (private), gender (all-boys), and religious information (Catholic) of St. Michael&#39;s College School.    I don&#39;t agree that it is relevant information to give these details about Holy Name on the SMCS wiki. People reading the SMCS page quickly learn that Holy Name of Mary is the official sister school, and that it must be an all-girls school. That Holy Name is Catholic or private is also irrelavant in the SMCS article. If a reader interested in information on Holy Name wants to learn about it, he/she can go to the Holy Name wiki. I believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about SMCS (and the same for St. Mike&#39;s info on the HNMCS wiki).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by      The point of including this basic information is to show how Holy Name of Mary College School and St. Michael&#39;s College School are connected by virtue of their school type, single-gender, and religious affiliation. The inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools.  These parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools, and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article.     They are two separate institutions. If you want to write a paragraph describing the schools&#39; connections, that can be done in sub-article within the main article. Readers can go to the other school&#39;s wiki for more detailed information and don&#39;t need to see it in the introduction, where it appears as self-serving PR. See Basic Navigation in Wikipedia  &quot;&quot;Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information elsewhere. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. The reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached.&quot;&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About    So if understand correctly, the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view?     I only ask Mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools. In removing that content, Mikeycanuck commented (see View History), &quot;&quot;Removed superfluous information on Holy Name. Should be in HNM&#39;s wiki.&quot;&quot;  So Mikeycanuck, you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction, but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article?  I want to ensure we have reached agreement before I go ahead and add that paragraph.     The detailed information does not belong in the introduction, which should always be concise and relevant. In a later section, a description of the school&#39;s links is acceptable, if it is relevant. If SMCS chose Holy Name as its &quot;&quot;sister school&quot;&quot; for certain reasons, and they are verifiable, I would not object. I am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse.     I never</td>

It is the major single and early root cause for the Greek debt crisis. Without this root cause Greece could technically not have had this debt crisis because it could always have printed itself out of every debt volume as they did before with the drachma. But this cause is missing in the 100 WP pages and in the WP lead. The current lead only lists normal problems like &quot;&quot;structural weaknesses&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;recessions&quot;&quot;  (even though it is clear that Greece faced those normal problems for decades and always solved them with high drachma inflation if needed) - so without naming the root cause there is no cause for the Greek debt crisis. ::What happened after I proposed to have the main points in the article (at least in the lead as a summary) and also invited everybody to add/change/delete from my proposed the main point list? There were strong opponents working in a coordinated action, threatening to fight any significant change, saying one can not summarize a Greek debt crisis, saying &quot;&quot;Greek interests [need to have] a prominence&quot;&quot;) when describing the debt crisis in WP, saying they will not let other editors summarize it, and so on.

Again, welcome!   By the way, I noticed you have created the article Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld. Some of the sentences there seem copied directly from Dr Gerstenfeld’s homepage; this is not desirable, because it creates the impression that the article was copied from the homepage, which might be be a copyright violation. Perhaps you should try to rewrite the article a bit to avoid that. Also, some kind of indication about why Dr Gerstenfeld is notable would be nice to have (cf.

It&#39;s currently the second hit with a Google search with &#39;Vinny Burgoo&#39; (my one and only online identity for nearly ten years) and it&#39;s wholly bogus. Someone posted something in support of something very stupid I had done at Wiktionary (I called a serial Wiki tyrant a &#39;c**t&#39; after he had unambiguously broken Wiki&#39;s rules, then I compounded this by threatening him in what I thought at the time to be a transparently jocular manner, but wasn&#39;t) and this &#39;supporter&#39; was assumed to be me using another identity and another IP trying to get around a temporary block. I still use Wikipedia a lot but have no interest whatsoever in editing it ever again, so by all means say that I was blocked for disruptive editing (guilty: I got fed up with the lot of you) or whatever else I was accused of before this puppeteer nonsense was settled on (the crime kept changing) but I&#39;m not happy with what you currently show.  Take it down or else.  A genuine threat this time? We&#39;ll see.</td>

The figures currently quoted in the articles up to 1996 are usually &quot;&quot;estimates&quot;&quot; that have been taken from various charts message boards, calculated by enthusiasts from officially published yearly sales figures per artist (i.e. sales could be made up of one or more singles or albums, and estimating what percentage of sales were assigned to each record). As these are completely unofficial and unverifiable, I am thinking to remove them altogether or at least add a note that all figures are unofficial and estimated. In any case I don&#39;t think most people are interested in how many records the 37th best selling album of 1987 sold that year – it makes more sense to me to concentrate efforts into keeping List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom up to date.   &quot;</td>

Phrase by phrase that I disagree with: :# Only much later was it realized that the two processes [deformation and the creation of topography] were mostly not closely related, either in origin or in time. Very wrong. Deformation causes topography, and the generation of topography is synchronous with deformation. I will email you a copy of Dahlen and Suppe (1988), which shows that this is the case - send me a message so I have your address and can attach a PDF. They tackle the large-scale deformation of sedimentary rocks via folding and thrusting during orogenesis. :# ...fold-belt mountainous areas...: &quot;&quot;fold-belt&quot;&quot; isn&#39;t used professionally (AFAIK) to refer to a collisional mountain-building event. A minor thing though. :# Only in the very youngest, late Cenozoic mountains is there any evident causal relation between rock structure and surface landscape. and the following sentence: If I were British, I would call this &quot;&quot;utter twaddle&quot;&quot;. As I mentioned above, there is no way for many of the exposed structures to get to the surface without large amounts of rock uplift and erosion. And as a matter of fact, the trajectory of different units of rock through an orogen is in part determined by patterns of surface erosion. To keep it simple and send you one paper, you&#39;ll find this in and at the end of the paper by Dahlen and Suppe (1988). :  &quot;</td>

That is the real reason he hasn&#39;t toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on &quot;&quot;We&#39;ve Had Enough&quot;&quot; four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support all his siblings and parents. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, &quot;&quot;Dangerous&quot;&quot;, and it was thoroughly mediocre music. Almost all of Jackson&#39;s remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - a meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson&#39;s megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album weren&#39;t good, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, but the less said about that the better. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire the disgraced former King of Pop. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn&#39;t want to risk offending WJ&#39;s fans. Justin will continue to perform, while Jackson&#39;s active career finished a decade ago. ( )  &quot;</td>
